# CSE 2221: Software I - Software Components

**Overview**  
Explores foundational software engineering principles with a focus on design-by-contract and mathematical modeling. Emphasizes component-based software from a client perspective, layered data representation, and Java development.

## Core Competencies

- **Java Fundamentals**: Introduction to Java, basic I/O, value types, control structures, methods, calls, parameter passing.
- **Software Engineering**: Design-by-contract, packages, interfaces, classes, reference types, `equals`, and `toString` methods.
- **Components & Tools**: `XMLTree` and `NaturalNumber` components, UML class diagrams.
- **Advanced Concepts**: Layered implementations, recursion, specification-based testing, JUnit.
- **Data Structures & Generics**: Sequences, queues, stacks, sets, maps, and iterators.
- **GUI Development**: Swing for GUIs, Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.
- **Software Correctness**: Reasoning about correctness, loop invariants.

> **Tools Used**: Java, Eclipse.

# CSE 2221: Software I - Software Components

**Course Overview**  
This course covers the intellectual foundations of software engineering, emphasizing design-by-contract principles and mathematical modeling of software functionality. You will learn about component-based software from the client perspective and explore layered data representation.

## Key Topics Covered

### Java Programming Fundamentals
- Introduction to Java
- Basic input/output
- Value types and control structures
- Methods, calls, and parameter passing

### Software Engineering Principles
- **Software components**
- **Design-by-contract**
- Packages, interfaces, and classes
- Reference types, `equals`, and `toString` methods

### Components and Tools
- `XMLTree` components
- `NaturalNumber` components
- Introduction to UML class diagrams (or similar)

### Advanced Concepts
- Layered implementations of new `NaturalNumber` methods
- **Introduction to recursion**
- Specification-based testing and JUnit

### Generics and Data Structures
- **Generics** in Java
- `Sequence` components
- `Queue` components
- `Stack` components
- Iterators
- `Set` and `Map` components

### GUI Development
- Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) using **Swing**
- Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern

### Software Correctness and Reasoning
